# Using application layer protocols

## General

The layer 4 TCP loadbalancer transfers all data from one frontend connection to one backend. This will result in the following major problems:

1. One backend load would be higher than others if the netflow of a single connection is very high but other connections are not busy.
2. RPC is frequently used in the internal network. Almost all impl of rpc protocols would create a connection with a few connnections, and won't be closed in normal cases. If using the L4 loadbalancing, the backend rpc services won't be able to scale out.

So `vproxy` defines a set of interfaces which allow users to customize their own application level protocols, and to dispatch frames to different backend in one connection.

Now, `vproxy` already uses the interfaces to construct some built-in protcols for `HTTP/2`, `http/1.x`, `dubbo` and `thrift (framed)`.  
Actually these interfaces are built for the `HTTP/2`, which uses all functionality provided by these interfaces. See [here](https://github.com/wkgcass/vproxy/tree/master/src/main/java/vproxy/processor/http2). The core impl is here: [Http2SubContext.java](https://github.com/wkgcass/vproxy/blob/master/src/main/java/vproxy/processor/http2/Http2SubContext.java).  
The `dubbo` and `thrift (framed)` processors are much easier comparing to the `HTTP/2` impl. And `http/1.x` uses another coding style of these interfaces.

## How to use

When creating `tcp-lb`, specify the application level protocol to use in parameter `protocol ${}`, e.g. `protocol h2`.

Current built in protocols are:

* http: adaptive protocol for h2 and http/1.x
* h2: `http/2`
* http/1.x: `http/1.1` and `http/1.0`
* dubbo: for alibaba dubbo rpc
* framed-int32: could be used with framed thrift, which uses an int32 length field

Input your protocol name which corresponds to your `Processor` when using a customized protocol.

## How to customize protocols

### Example

We provide a processor impl example, see [here](https://github.com/wkgcass/vproxy-customized-application-layer-protocols-example). Here we defined a very simple application level protocol: the first 3 bytes represnets the payload length, and followed by the payload. See example code for more info.

For more complex protocols, you may refer to the built-in http2 impl instead of the example.

To let vproxy load your processors, you may use the modular `provides ... with ...` in `module-info` or traditional definitions in `META-INF/services/vproxy.processor.ProcessorRegistry`.

Or when both not working (e.g. when packing everything into one fat jar), you can also call `DefaultProcessorRegistry.getInstance().register(processor)` to register.

### Interfaces

package [vproxy.processor](https://github.com/wkgcass/vproxy/tree/master/src/main/java/vproxy/processor);

* [ProcessorRegistry](https://github.com/wkgcass/vproxy/blob/master/src/main/java/vproxy/processor/ProcessorRegistry.java) To register customized protocol into the `vproxy`.
* [Processor](https://github.com/wkgcass/vproxy/blob/master/src/main/java/vproxy/processor/Processor.java) The processor of your protocol

### Concepts

* Frontend connection：the connection from client to loadbalancer.
* Backend connection：the connection from loadbalancer to backend.
* lib：refers to `vproxy`.
* ctx：context，processing infomation about (one frontend connection + the derived backend connections).
* subCtx：sub context, processing information about one connection.

### Methods of processor interface

The Processor interface defines the following methods:

* `String name()` name of the protocol
* `String[] alpn()` the alpn strings when using tls, ordered by priority desc
* `CTX init()` the context
* `SUB initSub(CTX ctx, int id)` creating a sub context
* `Mode mode(CTX ctx, SUB sub)` the current processing mode，maybe `handle` or `proxy`
* `boolean expectNewFrame(CTX ctx, SUB sub)` whether the processor is expecting a new frame (i.e. the frames are already transmitted)
* `int len(CTX ctx, SUB sub)` current expected data length
* `ByteArray feed(CTX ctx, SUB sub, ByteArray data)` feed data from the source connection to the processor, and return the data to be sent to the target connection
* `ByteArray produce(CTX ctx, SUB sub)` produce data to the source connection (will only be called on backend connections)
* `void proxyDone(CTX ctx, SUB sub)` inform that the proxy is done
* `int connection(CTX ctx, SUB front)` decide which connection should data be sent to, -1 means to let the lib decide
* `void chosen(CTX ctx, SUB front, SUB sub)` inform which connection the lib chooses
* `ByteArray connected(CTX ctx, SUB sub)` inform that a new connection has established
* `int PROXY_ZERO_COPY_THRESHOLD()` the threshold for performing zero copy

### How the lib works

```python
# 1.when the frontend connection is established
def on_frontend_connection_establish():
  ctx = init() # 2.create the context
  fctx = initSub(ctx, 0) # 3.create the sub context for frontend connection

# 4.when data arrives on the frontend connection
def on_frontend_data():
  len = len(ctx, fctx) # 5.retrieve the length of expected data
  if (mode(ctx, fctx) == 'handle'):
    data = _read(frontend_conn, len) # retrieve data of length `len` from frontend connection
    data = feed(ctx, fctx, data) # 6.send data to processor, and generate data to send to backend
    conn_id = connection(ctx, fctx) # 7.select which connection to send data to
    backend_conn = get_backend_conn(connId)
    _write(backend_conn, data) # send data to backend connection
  else: # mode == 'proxy'
    conn_id = connection(ctx, fctx) # 11.select which connection to send data to
    backend_conn = get_backend_conn(connId)
    if len > PROXY_ZERO_COPY_THRESHOLD():
      _proxy_zero_copy(from=frontend_conn, to=backend_conn, len) # proxy to backend
    else:
      _proxy(from=frontend_conn, to=backend_conn, len) # proxy to backend
    proxyDone(ctx, fctx) # 12.inform that proxy completed

# retrieve the backend connection
def get_backend_conn(conn_id):
  if (conn_id != -1): # if connId is specified
    return _existing_connection(conn_id) # get existing connection

  backend_conn = _get_backend_connection() # retrieve a backend connection
  conn_id = _get_next_conn_id()
  bctx = initSub(ctx, conn_id) # 8.create the sub context for backend connection
  bdata = connected(ctx, bctx) # 9.retrieve data which will be sent to backend
  chosen(ctx, fctx, bctx) # 10.inform the processor that the backend is selected
  _write(backend_conn, bdata) # send data when it's connected

# 13.when data arrives on backend connection
def on_backend_data():
  len = len(ctx, bctx) # 14.retrieve the length of data
  if (mode(ctx, bctx) == 'handle'):
    data = _read(conn, len) # read data with length `len` from backend connection
    data = feed(ctx, bctx, data) # 15.feed processor with data and retrieve the data to be sent to frontend connection
    data2 = produce(ctx, bctx) # 16.retrieve data to be reply to backend
    _write(backend_conn, data2) # reply data to backend
    _write(frontend_conn, data) # send data to frontend connection
  else: # mode == 'proxy'
    if len > PROXY_ZERO_COPY_THRESHOLD():
      _proxy_zero_copy(from=backend_conn, to=frontend_conn, len)
    else:
      _proxy(from=backend_conn, to=frontend_conn, len)
    proxyDone(ctx, bctx) # 17.the proxy is done
  if (expectNewFrame(ctx, bctx)): # 18.check whether frames of the backend are transmitted
    _handle_another_backend()
```
